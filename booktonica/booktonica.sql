9	Homesick for Another World 	2017-01-17	7	https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1469408007l/30079724.jpg	There's something eerily unsettling about Ottessa Moshfegh's stories, something almost dangerous, while also being delightful, and even laugh-out-loud funny. Her characters are all unsteady on their feet in one way or another; they all yearn for connection and betterment, though each in very different ways, but they are often tripped up by their own baser impulses and existential insecurities.	\N

A Memoir
8	Invisible Women	2019-03-12	6	https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1550780394l/44083621._SY475_.jpg	Data is fundamental to the modern world. From economic development, to healthcare, to education and public policy, we rely on numbers to allocate resources and make crucial decisions. But because so much data fails to take into account gender, because it treats men as the default and women as atypical, bias and discrimination are baked into our systems. And women pay tremendous costs for this bias, in time, money, and often with their lives.	Data Bias in a World Designed for Men 
6	Herding Cats 	2018-03-27	3	https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1522799608l/35924705._SX318_.jpg	Adjusting to life as a world-famous cartoonist isn't easy. Terrifying deadlines, piles of junk-food wrappers under a glowing computer screen, and an ever-growing horde of pets....umm, never mind--it's pretty much the same.	\N

3	You Can't Touch My Hair	2016-10-04	5	https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1477907975l/29496435._SY475_.jpg	A hilarious and affecting essay collection about race, gender, and pop culture from celebrated stand-up comedian and WNYC podcaster Phoebe Robinson.	And Other Things I Still Have to Explain
7	 Everything's Trash, But It's Okay 	2018-10-16	5	https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1527080689l/38649805.jpg	Robinson's latest essay collection is a call to arms. She tackles a wide range of topics, such as giving feminism a tough-love talk in hopes it can become more intersectional; telling society's beauty standards to kick rocks; and demanding that toxic masculinity close its mouth and legs (enough with the manspreading already!), and get out of the way so true progress can happen.	\N
5	Adulthood Is a Myth 	2016-03-08	3	https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1481219756l/25855506._SX318_.jpg	Are you a special snowflake?\nDo you enjoy networking to advance your career?\nIs adulthood an exciting new challenge for which you feel fully prepared?\n\nUgh. Please go away.	\N
4	Big Mushy Happy Lump	2017-03-07	3	https://i.gr-assets.com/images/S/compressed.photo.goodreads.com/books/1490071048l/30754980._SX318_.jpg	Sarah Andersen's second comics collection picks up right where the first left off - huddled under a pile of blankets avoiding the responsibilities of the real world.	\N
